# Climate Change Analysis

A project analyzing climate change using authentic datasets from **NOAA** and **NASA**. This project aims to enhance understanding of climate change through data-driven activities and modeling.

## Overview

This project contains Python-based analyses and visualizations to study various aspects of climate change. It includes four hands-on activities designed for students, researchers, and educators to explore climate trends, carbon emissions, and predictive modeling.

## Activities

### 1. Exploring Global Temperature Trends
- **Objective**: Analyze global temperature anomalies over time to identify climate patterns.
- **Dataset**: NASA's GISTEMP global temperature anomaly data.
- **Output**: Line charts showing annual and monthly temperature trends.

### 2. Visualizing Climate Trends with Heatmaps
- **Objective**: Use heatmaps to visualize long-term temperature changes by year and season.
- **Dataset**: Processed temperature anomaly data from NASA.
- **Output**: Heatmaps highlighting seasonal variations and long-term warming trends.

### 3. Analyzing Carbon Emissions by Region
- **Objective**: Compare global carbon emissions and examine disparities across regions.
- **Dataset**: CO₂ emissions dataset from Our World in Data (OWID).
- **Output**: Bar charts showing the top carbon-emitting countries/regions.

### 4. Modeling Future Climate Scenarios
- **Objective**: Build a predictive model using historical CO₂ data to forecast future CO₂ concentration levels.
- **Dataset**: NOAA's CO₂ monthly mean data.
- **Output**: Linear regression projections of CO₂ levels up to 2100.

## Key Features
- **Authentic datasets** from:
  - [NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/data.html)
  - [NASA GISTEMP](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/)
- Comprehensive preprocessing to make datasets analysis-ready while preserving data integrity.
- Step-by-step Python code with visual outputs for each activity.
- Reproducible and well-documented workflow.
